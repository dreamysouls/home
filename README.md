# dreamysouls/home — GitHub Pages test

This repository hosts a simple "Hello World" test page for GitHub Pages.

Files:
- index.html — the site entry point
- .nojekyll — disables Jekyll processing so files like index.html are served as-is

To publish:
1. GitHub Pages is set to publish from the gh-pages branch. The site will be available at https://dreamysouls.github.io/home/ once GitHub finishes building.
